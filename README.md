Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms
Objective


The objective of this project is to identify the relationships between car prices and various independent variables. This provides management with a powerful tool to understand and predict car pricing dynamics, facilitating data-driven decision-making.


Dataset


The dataset used for this project is CarPrice Dataset, which contains features related to car specifications and their corresponding prices.


Project Workflow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing


2.Loading: The CarPrice dataset was loaded for analysis.

Preprocessing Steps:

Handling missing values to maintain dataset integrity.

Encoding categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.

Scaling numerical features to standardize the dataset.

Data Split: The data was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation and validation.


2. Model Implementation

Five regression algorithms were implemented to predict car prices:

a)Linear Regression

Captures the linear relationship between features and car prices.

b)Decision Tree Regressor

Creates a tree structure based on decision rules for non-linear predictions.

c)Random Forest Regressor

An ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

d)Gradient Boosting Regressor

Sequentially builds models where each corrects the errors of the previous ones.

e)Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Fits data within a margin, optimizing for the best boundary for predictions.

3. Model Evaluation:

Each model's performance was evaluated using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and robustness of each model. The comparison allowed for the identification of the best-performing model as Random Forest Regressor.


 4.Feature Importance Analysis:
 
An analysis was conducted to determine which variables significantly impact car prices. Feature importance was evaluated using methods like feature importance scores from ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and correlation analysis. This step provided valuable insights into which features are most influential in determining car prices.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

The best-performing model underwent hyperparameter tuning to further enhance its performance. Techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search were used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, resulting in improved model accuracy and reliability.



Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the relationships between car prices and independent variables. Key outcomes include:

A predictive model to forecast car prices with high accuracy.

Insights into influential features impacting car prices, enabling better business strategy formulation.

A framework for integrating machine learning into car price analysis and decision-making.
